# Machine Learning Model For Deployment on Google Cloud Platform.
This Is an API that I have created to predect the chance of addmission of students.
I have used LinearRegression algorithm to for this.
This model is created on a dataset which have Student's different Scores which they have gained, based on these score I have predicted their chance of addmisssion.
Firstly I have tested this API in my local machine after that I have deployed it on Google Cloud Platform to see the result.


Framework/IDE used: Jupyter Notebook,Pycharm,Flask
